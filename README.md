# Friendly and Enemy NPC Maker
Input a model's QC and output a friendly and enemy NPC version.

# What Does the Program Do?
It takes your QC, and duplicates it twice with a new name, renames the mdl, excludes previous $IncludeModels, and adds new necessary $IncludeModels for the NPCs.

Also includes a lua sample for adding NPCs to the game.
